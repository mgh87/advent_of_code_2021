# Advent of Code 2021

I started the first 4 days of this year's advent of code in Rust,
but I decided to switch to Kotlin with day 5.
Long story short it's more of a competition in my company than expected,
and I only have now 4 days XP in Rust. (Yes just for advent of code).

I hope I can produce some nice bits of code which are worth sharing.
